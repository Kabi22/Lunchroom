Lunchroom

## Our Objective

To create an interactive voice chat web application using positional audio. Our aim is to recreate the nuances of in person conversations (the asides, talking across the room, whispers, etc.) by utilizing positional audio and a user’s in-app position to allow for virtual conversations. For example, by utilizing positional audio, interjecting a conversation is much more natural, compared with that of current video calling platforms where it is difficult when speakers overlap. Our idea stems from the nostalgic atmosphere a school lunch table brings. Users would be able to, based on where they are in the application’s setup position, hear people from a distance the further they are and talk to your neighbors easily compared to people across from you or further as if you were in the same room together.
